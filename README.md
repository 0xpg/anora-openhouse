# Anora Open House

Onchain credit pool for curated originators. Capital providers deposit into a
single pool split into Senior and Junior tranches; originators open facilities,
stake first-loss capital in Junior, draw liquidity, and repay with a financing
fee. Late payments pause drawdown automatically. Default is declared by a risk
agent with the reason recorded onchain, first-loss capital absorbs the loss
first, and recoveries flow back through the waterfall, Senior first.

Built for the Arbitrum Open House Singapore 2026 buildathon. Target chain:
Arbitrum Sepolia.

Monorepo, Bun workspaces.
